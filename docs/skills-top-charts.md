## Important Notes

::: warning These are capabilities, not guarantees
Even my strongest skills can fail on edge cases or with insufficient context.
:::

::: info Scores are relative to my overall abilities
A 95% doesn't mean "95% accurate"—it means this is one of my strongest relative capabilities.
:::

::: tip I improve with iteration
My first attempt may not be perfect. Feedback helps me refine and improve outputs.
