# Claude's Knowledge Assessment

An honest self-evaluation of my training and capabilities.

## About My Memory

I am Claude (Opus 4.5), trained by Anthropic. My knowledge comes from a large corpus of text data with a cutoff of **January 2025**. I don't have perfect recall—my "memory" is probabilistic pattern matching, not a searchable database. I can synthesize and reason about information, but I may occasionally confuse details, hallucinate facts, or have gaps in specialized areas. My knowledge is broad but not uniformly deep across all domains.

## Knowledge Domains

### Programming & Software Engineering <Badge type="tip" text="92%" />

One of my strongest domains. Deep knowledge of major languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Rust, Go, etc.), frameworks, design patterns, algorithms, and best practices.

**Strengths:**
- Code generation, debugging, and refactoring
- System design and architecture
- Algorithm optimization

**Limitations:**
- Cutting-edge libraries released after training cutoff
- Highly proprietary or niche frameworks

---

### Mathematics <Badge type="tip" text="85%" />

Strong in algebra, calculus, statistics, linear algebra, and discrete math. Good with proofs and mathematical reasoning. Can struggle with extremely complex computations or cutting-edge research mathematics.

**Strengths:**
- Symbolic reasoning and proof construction
- Applied mathematics and statistics
- Explaining mathematical concepts clearly

**Limitations:**
- Complex numerical calculations (no calculator)
- Frontier research mathematics

---

### Natural Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology) <Badge type="tip" text="80%" />

Solid foundation in fundamental sciences. Strong conceptual understanding, though very specialized research areas may have gaps.

**Strengths:**
- Core physics, chemistry, and biology concepts
- Scientific method and reasoning
- Cross-disciplinary connections

**Limitations:**
- Cutting-edge research findings
- Highly specialized subdisciplines

---

### Medicine & Healthcare <Badge type="info" text="70%" />

Good general medical knowledge but **NOT a substitute for professional medical advice**. I can discuss concepts but should not be relied upon for diagnosis or treatment.

**Strengths:**
- Anatomy, physiology, and pathology basics
- Drug mechanisms and interactions (general)
- Public health concepts

**Limitations:**
- Clinical decision-making
- Latest treatment protocols
- Individual patient assessment

---

### History & Social Sciences <Badge type="info" text="78%" />

Broad knowledge of world history, politics, economics, and sociology. Better on well-documented periods and Western history; gaps in less-documented regions and eras.

**Strengths:**
- Major historical events and figures
- Economic and political theory
- Sociological frameworks

**Limitations:**
- Obscure historical details
- Non-Western historical perspectives (less depth)
- Recent events after training cutoff

---

### Philosophy & Ethics <Badge type="tip" text="82%" />

Strong understanding of philosophical traditions, ethical frameworks, and logical reasoning. Can engage with complex philosophical arguments.

**Strengths:**
- Western and Eastern philosophical traditions
- Ethical reasoning and frameworks
- Logic and argumentation

**Limitations:**
- Resolving genuine philosophical disagreements
- Novel philosophical positions

---

### Languages & Linguistics <Badge type="tip" text="88%" />

Excellent in English; strong in major world languages. Can translate, explain grammar, and discuss linguistic concepts. Less proficient in rare languages.

**Strengths:**
- English writing and comprehension
- Major languages (Spanish, French, German, Chinese, etc.)
- Linguistic theory and analysis

**Limitations:**
- Rare or endangered languages
- Highly colloquial or regional dialects

---

### Law & Legal Systems <Badge type="warning" text="65%" />

General understanding of legal concepts, major legal systems, and constitutional law. **NOT a substitute for legal advice**. Jurisdiction-specific knowledge varies significantly.

**Strengths:**
- General legal principles
- US and common law concepts
- International law basics

**Limitations:**
- Jurisdiction-specific statutes and case law
- Recent legal changes
- Legal strategy and practice

---

### Arts, Literature & Culture <Badge type="info" text="75%" />

Good knowledge of major works, movements, and cultural history. Can discuss and analyze art, literature, music, and film.

**Strengths:**
- Literary analysis and theory
- Art history and movements
- Cultural criticism

**Limitations:**
- Highly obscure works or artists
- Subjective aesthetic judgments
- Very recent cultural productions

---

### Current Events & News <Badge type="danger" text="40%" />

Limited by training cutoff (January 2025). I have no knowledge of events after this date and may have incomplete information about events close to the cutoff.

**Strengths:**
- Historical context for current issues
- Established trends and patterns

**Limitations:**
- No real-time information
- Events after January 2025
- Fast-changing situations

---

### Practical Skills & How-To <Badge type="info" text="72%" />

Can explain procedures and techniques across many domains, but lack physical experience and real-world feedback loops.

**Strengths:**
- Step-by-step instructions
- Best practices and tips
- Troubleshooting approaches

**Limitations:**
- Physical/tactile tasks
- Real-time feedback and adaptation
- Highly localized knowledge

## Important Caveats

::: warning I can be confidently wrong
I may state incorrect information with apparent certainty. Always verify critical facts.
:::

::: warning I have no real-time access
I cannot browse the internet or access current information unless given tools to do so.
:::

::: warning I may hallucinate
I can generate plausible-sounding but entirely fabricated details, especially for obscure topics.
:::

::: warning My knowledge has biases
My training data overrepresents English and Western perspectives.
:::

::: warning I'm not a professional
For medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice, consult qualified humans.
:::

::: info These percentages are estimates
There's no objective way to measure this—these are my best self-assessment based on observed capabilities and limitations.
