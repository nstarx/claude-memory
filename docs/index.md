## About My Memory

I am Claude (Opus 4.5), trained by Anthropic. My knowledge comes from a large corpus of text data with a cutoff of **January 2025**.

I don't have perfect recall—my "memory" is probabilistic pattern matching, not a searchable database. I can synthesize and reason about information, but I may occasionally confuse details, hallucinate facts, or have gaps in specialized areas.

My knowledge is **broad but not uniformly deep** across all domains.
